		<h3>INTO THE FUTURE
		</h3><br>
		<br>
		<p>The promise of tomorrow, starts with today. For all of the 24 years of our existence, we have never believed
			otherwise. An ear to the ground has certainly helped. With the exemplary vision of Shri Gulshan Kumar, the
			group has risen to phenomenal heights. And inheriting the same farsightedness and ability to capitalise on
			small opportunities, the present Managing Director, Mr. Bhushan Kumar leads the group into the future, with
			the same fixity of purpose.<br>
			<br>

			Today, we are a diversified group with $90 million in our core business of Consumer Electronics, CDs,
			Audio/Video Magnetic Tapes and Cassettes. All of which has been achieved through a keen perception of the
			changing consumer practices, infrastructural investment, technological upgradations and a skilled, cohesive
			workforce. Above all, an aggressive commitment towards quality through technical and professional perfection
			is what we strictly adhere to.
		</p><br>
		<br>


		<h3>Our Quality</h3><br>
		<br>
		<p>A quality product at qualitative prices is what we believe in. We endeavour to envisage the consumers needs
			and to keep them thoroughly satisfied.<br>
			<br>

			The market leader is invariably one with the most satisfied consumers. And that is precisely the way we
			conduct our business. The ISO 9002 certification is a proud feather in our cap. With an ultra modern R & D
			laboratory and advanced quality control department, we strive to excel in our quest to be the best.
		</p>
		<br><br>

		<h3>Our Resources</h3><br><br>

		<p>One of our most precious assets are our rights to over 2000 Video and 35,000 Audio titles, comprising of
			nearly 24,000 hours of music software carefully built over the years. And these, together with our
			production facilities represent an effective thrust into film entertainment. Furthermore a Music Bank was
			initiated, the first in the country, to prove a storehouse of new titles, whenever and wherever it is
			needed.<br><br>

			With the foresight to create a Talent Bank, SCI is arguably the largest promoter of new talent. Quite a
			handful to the stars of today started their careers with T-Series. Talent needs only a simple chance to
			prove it’s worth and we are delighted to provide that spur.</p>
